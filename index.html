    		<h2>Air Quality WebApp</h2>
		<div>
			<h4> To Do: </h4>
			<p>For this project, you will create a single page application about air quality. You will use at least 2 external APIs to retrieve data from (Leaflet (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site., and the Open AQ Platform (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.). Your application should be interactive, responsive, and allow a user to investigate air quality from various geographical regions. This project will also incorporate Vue JS (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. as a framework to make building the app simpler. You will also create a second web page - "About the project", which will document your team, your development process, and demo the final application with interesting findings. For this project, you are free to use other JavaScript or CSS libraries as you see fit.</p>
<p>About the Data Sets
Leaflet:
The Leaflet API allows you to render interactive maps in your web page as well as overlay data on top of the map. The map can be modified either by user interaction or by JavaScript commands.
</p>

<p>Open AQ Platform:
The Open AQ Platform maintains a rolling 90 day historical data set of air quality measures (i.e. everything from today back until 90 days ago). The data set includes information about locations where measurements exist (and how many measurements were taken), measurements of different particles in the air (carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, etc.), and timestamps for when measurements were taken.

<p>To earn 55/75 points (grade: C)</p>


<p>Show a 2 independent maps (side-by-side) using the Leaflet API
Pan and zoom available with mouse click-and-drag and scroll wheel interaction 
Have an input box for a user to type a location (lat/long coordinates)
Map should update when location is entered
Input box text should update with new location (lat/long coordinates) when map is panned
Get air quality measurements from the Open AQ Platform for the past 30 days
Average measurements of the same particle taken at the same location
Only retrieve data from locations shown on the map (account for both center and zoom level)
Open AQ Platform accepts requests with a lat/long center and a radius. HINT: get lat/long coordinates for the NW and SE corners of the map, calculate the distance between them (haversine formula we did in class), and divide by 2 for the radius.
Draw markers on the map for each location their is at least one measurement
Create a popup with actual measurement averages when hovering over a marker
Populate a table for each map with air quality measurements (from the Open AQ Platform API)
Table should automatically update data based on location shown in map
It is OK to display all results in the table even though the circle of retrieved data will not exactly match the rectangular map
Table should show all measurements, not just the averages
"About the Project" page
Short bio about each team member (including a photo)
Description of the tools (frameworks, APIs, etc.) you used to create the application
Video demo of the application (2 - 4 minutes)
Can natively embed or upload to YouTube and embed
Six interesting findings that you discovered using your application
NOTE: it is best to trigger updates at the end of user interaction. Otherwise, continuous requests will be sent and could flood the Open AQ Platform servers, which would slow down your app. A good idea would be to trigger an update after a 200ms timeout with no user activity (pan / zoom).

<p>4 additional points for each item completed on the list below

Create UI controls to filter data per map
Filter based on particle type
Filter based on measurement values for each particle type (e.g. only show co > 1.3, ammonia > 72.9, ...)
Allow different historical data to be retrieved (select a date/time range within the last 90 days)
Use the Nominatim API (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.) to search via place name in addition to lat/long coordinates
Also update search box location to location name when panning the map
Style the background color of particle values in the table so they match the Air Quality Index from the EPA
https://airnowtest.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-09/aqi-technical-assistance-document-sept-2018_0.pdf (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. (colors - page 2, values - page 4)
If levels of one or more particle are "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" (orange) or higher, add a banner with the AQI descriptor (page 2)
Also include a legend for the colors
Add option for showing a heatmap visualization overlay on the map when only one particle type selected
Color should represent the measurement value
Include an easy-to-read legend
Do NOT use a rainbow color scale

Allow either map (along with the location input box) to go fullscreen
